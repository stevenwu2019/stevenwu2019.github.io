# Salutations!

Thanks for taking the time to mosey through my website and find this particular blog post!

At the moment, the website is pretty bare-bones, but in the near future I hope to find a nice theme and touch up this place a bit. 

I also plan to turn this page into a repository on all of my thoughts that I am interested in sharing with the Internet-viewing public. If you've met me IRL, then you probably have realized I like to talk **a lot** about almost anything, so *hopefully* I can transfer some of that chatter into a more refined, helpful, and socially acceptable format as a blog.



I'll close this first post with a thematically-relevant quote by *Charlotte's Web* author E.B. White:

###"With the right words, you can change the world."
